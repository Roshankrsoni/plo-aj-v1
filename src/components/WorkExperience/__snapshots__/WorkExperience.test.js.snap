        In Deloitte, I started with a public sector project for State of Michigan where we built a custom application on salesforce using salesforce lightning components. Along with the project I worked on several Firm initiatives built on React Js - One of the major project being Elixir where we build a React app for non developers similar to wordpress/squarespace having the drag and drop functionality to generate salesforce components. Due to the open culture in Deloitte, I also got the opportunity to work on design projects which involved in-house web/mobile app design, several posters, mailers, infographics, brochure designs and branding.
